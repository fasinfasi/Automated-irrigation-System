# AgroAssist - Automated-Irrigation-System ðŸŒ±
AgroAssist is a smart sensor-based irrigation system designed to optimize water usage, enhance plant health, and simplify agriculture management through real-time monitoring and intelligent control. The system is ideal for farmers, gardeners, and anyone interested in sustainable farming practices.

Here use many components for automation : -

ESP32 is a microcontroller it act as a brain of this system it capable to store a single code, manipulate data and make actions if need.
Arduino software for write code and upload to microcontroller
DHT11(Digital Temperature and Humidity) sensor to read real time temperature and humidity.
Soil moisture sensor can measure the moisture presented in the soil.
Rain drop module detect the rain status.
Water motor pump used to supply water when the microcontroller trigger.
OLED display show real time data.
Blynk app used for access data remotely from any where.
